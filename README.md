MOSAIC

Mosaic is a layout framework that allows you to position "tiles" easily in a premade grid and then auto-layout more tiles around them.
Inspired by Masonry, and similar to Packery (both by github.com/desandro), Mosaic is great for mixing dynamic and static content in the same layout.
Like Packery, you can specify tiles that you want to essentially keep the same position, and you can turn on a draggable mode that allows you to position or re-position elements easily. Unlike Packery, your positioned tiles are positioned relative to the grid you're using, and so is already entirely integrated into your layout.


NOTES:
1. If you want to use the grid framework with something like masonry, you'll need to turn off the margin on rows thing. Otherwise, it totally works (besides placing stuff, obviously);
